to generate the project and it's parts.

    /src$ poetry new epic_project1_part3
    /src$ mkdir epic_project1_part3/epic_project1
    /src$ mv epic_project1_part3/epic_project1_part3 epic_project1_part3/epic_project1/part3

so the main package is `epic_project1`
it's a namespace package
[naemspace-packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/)

you `must` edit the code generated by poetry in the toml file, to change 
the location of the package.

from:

    packages = [{include = "epic_project1_part3"}]

to:

    packages = [{include = "epic_project1"}]

to add dependencies you must add them to the toml file like:

    [tool.poetry.dependencies]
    python = "^3.10"
    epic_project1_part2 = { path = "../epic_project1_part2/"}
    epic_project1_part3 = { path = "../epic_project1_part3/"}
